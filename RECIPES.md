  /opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/certs

and run
  /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin/c_rehash

openssl@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@3 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@3 you may need to set:

    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found in:
    /opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.1/

To restart php after an upgrade:
  brew services restart php
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
